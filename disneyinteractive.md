## Work Placement - Production and Operations intern, Disney Interactive, The Walt Disney Company

**About the placement:** For a year I worked at The Walt Disney Company in London. During this year, I worked as Production and Operations intern where my main role was to update the "Parks" and "Shows" section pages across the Disney websites in Europe, Middle East and Africa. During this year I also got to write an article, learn more about SEO and build Ticket Showcase pages for Disney Tickets. 
Below are some examples of projects that I have worked on.

### Parks pages - Monthly

These pages were updated every two weeks, with any updates to broadway shows while staying in contact with different teams about what updates had been made.
