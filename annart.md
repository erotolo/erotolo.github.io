## Freelance work - Anna Arts photography

**About the placement:** This site was built for a phtotographer based in Leamington. She had her logo and wanted me to create a new site for her for potential customers to look at. The site is currently being updated frequently with small changes and improvements, and an SQL database is soon to be integrated in to the albums to optimise future updates.
