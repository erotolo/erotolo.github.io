## Movie Search - API Project

**About the project** This site was created for a university project. A site was created to encorporate a RESTful API database (The Movie Database) and display the JSON results in a clear, informative and responsive way. This site allows users to log in to The Movie Database, search for a range of films and add and remove them to a favourites list. The site was coded in php/HTML/CSS.
